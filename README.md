# OpenBankingProject.ch

The OpenBankingProject.ch will offer professionals working in the financial industry an one stop access point with relevant information about application programming interfaces (API) that fintech companies, banks and providers with an operational base in Switzerland are developing and using.

The project follows the open source approach. The results are generally made available to all interested parties and can also be maintained and supplemented by everyone as part of a curated process. Participation as a partner or in the community is explicitly open to all companies.
