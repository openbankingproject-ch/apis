# Contributing

Welcome to the GitHub page of the Swiss NextGen API. Please open an issue if you want to suggest new features or submit adjustments (ex. fixing a typo), you can also submit a pull request directly.

## Regular Updates to the API

- [Berlin Group XS2A API](https://www.berlin-group.org/nextgenpsd2-downloads) updates: as soon as possible after new releases
- [Six Swiss Payments Standards](https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/banking-services/standardization/iso-payments.html): yearly

## Rules

- Adjustments to the API can be submitted as an issue or directly as a pull request
- Outstanding adjustments will be reviewed and prioritized regularly by the admins
- Adjustments must be committed to a feature or bugfix branch (named feature/<name> or bugfix/<name>) followed by a pull request to develop.
- An issue must be closed by the person that opened it
- If an issue or pull request must be further discussed during prioritization, it will be moved up one stage (see Prioritization)

## Prioritization

1. Directly solvable
2. To be discussed by admins
3. To be discussed by the OBP Partners
4. To be developed by the OPB Community
